### Project Description

Smile to Stop is a fun and quirky project that turns off your alarm only when you smile.Instead of hitting a snooze button, you‚Äôre forced to smile at your screen ‚Äî literally! The alarm keeps ringing until your face detection camera catches a genuine smile.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, many individuals struggle with stress, anxiety, and irregular sleeping patterns. While alarm clocks are essential for staying punctual, the abrupt and often harsh nature of alarms can negatively affect a person's mood at the start of the day.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
For lazy people to wake up from bed.The "Smile-to-Stop Alarm System" introduces an innovative approach to stopping alarms‚Äîfacial recognition powered by smile detection. This web-based application sets an alarm using a user-defined time and activates the webcam at the alarm moment.
